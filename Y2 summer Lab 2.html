	<h1>BALLET</h1>
	<h2>the beginning of ballet</h2>
	<p class="italic">Ballet traces its origins to the Italian Renaissance,when it was developed as a court entertainment.During the 15th and 16th centuries the dance technique became formalized.</p>
	<br/>
	<p>The epicentre of the art moved to France following the marriage of the Italian-born aristocrat Catherine de Médicis to Henry II of France. A court musician and choreographer named Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx devised Ballet comique de la reine (1581; “The Queen’s Comic Ballet”), which inaugurated a long tradition of court ballets in France that reached its peak under Louis XIV in the mid-17th century.</p>
